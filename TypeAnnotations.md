Background
==========

Increasingly as developers we're spending more of our development effort on the client side; whether iPhone/iPad/iPod, Android, mobile phones, tablets & set top boxes, web applications and native desktop applications. In many ways the server side is often becoming more simple (e.g. server side might be SimpleDb/BigTable/CouchDb et al). So far the clear leader in a universal language & platform for rich UIs is HTML + CSS + JavaScript. (Ducks flamewars).

As many of us are aware JavaScript [has some issues](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748) such as == not working, lexical scoping being broken etc. However [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) creates a simple elegant ruby/python style language syntax that compiles direct to native JS. So no weird Java wrappers or very slow compilation steps (we're aiming at UI stuff which you want very rapid save & [auto-browser reload]()) like GWT etc. You hack JavaScript just in an elegant syntax which hides the bad parts.


UberScript
==========
 
This fork of the [CoffeeScript language](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) adds optional type annotations.  Ideally we'd like these fairly minor changes to get merged back into  [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/), though if thats not an option we need another name for this fork. Current working name is UberScript (as it supports various points on the religious dynamic-static type checking debate ;).

We've added type annotations to every point of the language AST; we've only added them so far to the grammar for assignments - but they should be most places in the language soon such as function arguments & object properties etc.

So in UberScript you can now do stuff like this:

    foo <: String = "hey"
    bar <: Array<People> = something()
    
The "<:" symbol is used to attach a static type annotation. I went with "<:" as ":" and most other ASCII single tokens are all taken in JS / CoffeeScript - am not totally wedded to it, kinda thought it looked vaguely like the one-many relationships or set membership etc.

The JS code generated includes the comments that the [Google Closure Compiler](http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler.html#types) can detect and do static type checks with...

e.g. generated JS...

    /** @type {String} */
    var foo = "hey"

which supports static type checking, unions, generics, structural type checking and non-null checks etc.


So why the type annotations?
----------------------------

The type annotations are optional and concise syntax; they can be used to visit various parts of the dynamic-static type continuum based on your needs and tastes...

* do nothing; stick to really fast to load & parse JS code
* purely for documentation to help folks grok APIs and the actual expected types
* to generate runtime type checking assertions which could be enabled in debugging/testing but disabled in production. This lets you use the compiler to do more work for you, if you want.
* to perform actual static type checking using [Google Closure Compiler](http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler.html#types) as an optional, asynchronous build system; kinda like another set of tests if you like; they don't have to get in your way hacking that awesome UI code but can run on your CI system in the background.
* as optimisation metadata for V8 and other JavaScript VMs to do some wacky optimisation when you're running UberScript on the server side (e.g. in node.js)
* potentially we could generate fast static bytecode on a JVM if you want to reuse UberScript classes on the server side as well; possibly using [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/) or [Mirah](http://www.mirah.org/)


What if I don't want to use them
--------------------------------

Thats totally fine. In many ways lots of JavaScript pages are quite simple; doing a bit of Ajax + DOM manipulation with jQuery and whatnot; the help type checking brings (dynamic or static) doesn't help hugely. Thats totally fine!

However increasingly folks are writing bigger and bigger codebases in CoffeeScript; to run both on the client and server side; so type annotations can help you scale your code across different teams & help catch refactoring bugs earlier. Though YMMV so relax, don't worry - just enjoy CoffeeScript / UberScript and see if/when you wanna annotate some code with type annotations.
